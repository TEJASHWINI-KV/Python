# 🧠 Universal Learning Prompts — Use for ANY Topic

> **How to use:** Replace `[TOPIC]` with whatever you're studying.  
> Example: `[TOPIC]` = "Python decorators" or "OOP inheritance" or "async/await"  
> Copy-paste each prompt into an AI chat (GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Claude).

## 🟢 Level 1 — Understand the Concept

### Prompt 1 — Teach Me From Scratch
```
Teach me [TOPIC] like I'm a complete beginner with no prior knowledge.
- Start with a real-world analogy before any code
- Show the simplest possible example first
- Build up to a realistic, practical example
- At the end, tell me the ONE most important thing to remember about this
```

---

### Prompt 2 — Go Deeper
```
I understand the basics of [TOPIC]. Now go deeper. Cover:
- How it works under the hood
- Common variations and options
- Best practices that experienced developers follow
- What beginners usually get wrong about this
- When should I use this vs alternatives?
Show runnable code for every point.
```

---

### Prompt 3 — Real-World Usage
```
Show me how [TOPIC] is used in real production code.
- Give me 3 different real-world scenarios where this is used
- Show the code for each scenario
- Explain why this was the right tool for that situation
- Show me what the code would look like WITHOUT this concept (so I understand the value)
```

---

## 🟡 Level 2 — Test Yourself

### Prompt 4 — Predict the Output
```
Give me 10 code snippets about [TOPIC] where I have to predict the output 
before you reveal the answer. 
- Start easy, get progressively harder
- After I answer, explain WHY the output is what it is
- Focus on the surprising or non-obvious behaviors
```

---

### Prompt 5 — Find the Bug
```
Show me 5 buggy code snippets related to [TOPIC].
For each one:
- Let me spot the bug first
- Then tell me: what the bug is, why Python behaves that way, and how to fix it correctly
Include the most common real mistakes developers make with this concept.
```

---

### Prompt 6 — Solve a Problem
```
Give me a coding problem that requires using [TOPIC] to solve it properly.
- Use a real-world scenario, not abstract math
- Ask me to solve it before showing the answer
- Walk me through it step by step if I'm stuck
- After the solution, show me a better/more Pythonic version if one exists
- Tell me the time and space complexity
```

---

## 🔴 Level 3 — Interview Preparation

### Prompt 7 — Mock Interview
```
Act as a strict Python interviewer. Ask me questions about [TOPIC] one at a time.
After each answer I give:
- Tell me what was correct
- Tell me what was missing or wrong
- Give me the ideal answer a senior developer would give
Start easy and increase difficulty. Don't go to the next question until I answer.
```

---

### Prompt 8 — Edge Cases & Gotchas
```
What are the trickiest, most surprising, or most commonly misunderstood behaviors 
related to [TOPIC] in Python?
For each one:
- Show the code
- Ask me to predict the output
- Explain the underlying reason clearly
These should be the things that trip up even experienced developers.
```

---

### Prompt 9 — Compare & Contrast
```
Compare [TOPIC] with its alternatives or related concepts.
For each comparison:
- When do you use one over the other?
- What is the performance difference?
- Show a code example that highlights the difference clearly
Format it as a clear table + code examples.
```

---

## 🔵 Level 4 — Lock It In Memory

### Prompt 10 — Teach It Back
```
Ask me to explain [TOPIC] out loud as if I'm teaching it to a 10-year-old 
who has never programmed before.
- Ask me to explain 4-5 sub-concepts one at a time
- After each explanation I give, score it 1-10
- Tell me exactly what was missing or unclear
- Give me the ideal simple explanation
```

---

### Prompt 11 — Flashcard Generator
```
I just finished studying [TOPIC]. 
Create Q&A flashcards covering everything I need to remember.
Rules:
- Each card: one question on front, max 3 lines on back
- Include: core concept, syntax, gotchas, interview questions
- Order: easy cards first, hard cards last
- At the end, tell me which 3 cards are most important for interviews
```

## 📋 The Right Order to Use These Prompts

```
Morning (45 min):
  → Prompt 1  (learn from scratch)
  → Prompt 2  (go deeper)
  → Prompt 3  (real-world usage)

Afternoon (45 min):
  → Prompt 4  (predict output — test yourself)
  → Prompt 5  (find the bug)
  → Prompt 6  (solve a problem)

Evening (30 min):
  → Prompt 7  (mock interview)
  → Prompt 8  (edge cases)
  → Prompt 9  (compare & contrast)

Before bed (15 min):
  → Prompt 10 (teach it back — best memory technique!)
  → Prompt 11 (generate flashcards for next-day revision)
```
